# MarketPulse Data Pipeline

**MarketPulse Data Pipeline** is a data engineering project that ingests, processes, validates, and visualizes real-time financial data from the Polygon.io API. It incorporates Airflow, Kafka, Docker, Spark, PostgreSQL, and data visualization tools to provide insights into market trends.

## Project Structure

- **Data Ingestion**: Fetches data from the Polygon.io API.
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and transforms the ingested data.
- **Data Storage**: Loads processed data into PostgreSQL using a star schema.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data accuracy and consistency.
- **Data Analytics**: Provides insights with financial metrics.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboards using Plotly/Matplotlib.
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Tracks pipeline performance and sends notifications.
- **Archiving**: Cleans and archives old data automatically.

## To-Do List

### 1. Setup & Configuration:
- [x] Set up a GitHub repository for the project.
- [ ] Install necessary tools: Airflow, Kafka, Docker, Spark.
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database for data storage.
- [ ] Obtain API keys from Polygon.io and store securely.

### 2. Data Ingestion:
- [ ] Design an Airflow DAG for data ingestion.
- [ ] Fetch real-time data (stocks, forex, crypto) from the Polygon.io API.
- [ ] Save raw data as CSV or JSON files in the data lake.
- [ ] Schedule the DAG to run periodically (e.g., hourly).

### 3. Data Processing:
- [ ] Clean and transform ingested data (handle missing values, data types).
- [ ] Write Python or PySpark scripts for data transformation.

### 4. Data Storage:
- [ ] Create tables in PostgreSQL for structured data storage.
- [ ] Design and implement a star schema for efficient querying.
- [ ] Load the cleaned data into PostgreSQL tables.

### 5. Data Validation:
- [ ] Write Python scripts to validate data integrity and consistency.
- [ ] Automate validation checks post-ingestion.

### 6. Data Analytics:
- [ ] Calculate key metrics (moving averages, market trends, etc.).
- [ ] Write SQL queries and integrate them into the pipeline.
- [ ] Automate metric calculations in Airflow.

### 7. Data Visualization:
- [ ] Build interactive charts with Plotly or Matplotlib.
- [ ] Display stock performance and trends in a web-based dashboard.

### 8. Monitoring & Alerts:
- [ ] Implement monitoring for Airflow DAGs and tasks.
- [ ] Set up email alerts for failures or metric reports.
- [ ] Integrate monitoring and alerts into the Airflow pipeline.

### 9. Archiving & Cleanup:
- [ ] Automate archiving of old data (e.g., move to cold storage).
- [ ] Write tasks to clean up unused files from the data lake or server.

### 10. Machine Learning Model (optional):
- [ ] Explore simple predictive models (e.g., stock price prediction).
- [ ] Train and evaluate the model.
- [ ] Integrate the model into the data pipeline.

## Technologies Used
- **Airflow**: For task scheduling and orchestration.
- **Kafka**: For message streaming (optional).
- **Docker**: To containerize services.
- **Spark**: For scalable data processing.
- **PostgreSQL**: For data storage and management.
- **Polygon.io API**: Data source for financial markets.
- **Plotly / Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Python / PySpark**: For data processing and validation.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/marketpulse-data-pipeline.git
    ```

2. Set up Docker and Airflow by running:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

3. Schedule the Airflow DAG to start fetching data from Polygon.io.

4. Follow the progress of your pipeline in the Airflow UI.
